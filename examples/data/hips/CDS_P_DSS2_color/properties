obs_description      = Color composition generated by CDS. This HiPS survey is based on 2 others HiPS surveys, respectively DSS2-red and DSS2-blue HiPS, both of them directly generated from original scanned plates downloaded from STScI site. The red component has been built from POSS-II F, AAO-SES,SR and SERC-ER plates. The blue component has been build from POSS-II J and SERC-J,EJ. The green component is based on the mean of other components. Three missing plates from red survey (253, 260, 359) has been replaced by pixels from the DSSColor STScI jpeg survey. The 11 missing blue plates (mainly in galactic plane) have not been replaced (only red component).

obs_ack              = The Digitized Sky Surveys were produced at the Space Telescope Science Institute under U.S. Government grant NAG W-2166. The images of these surveys are based on photographic data obtained using the Oschin Schmidt Telescope on Palomar Mountain and the UK Schmidt Telescope. The plates were processed into the present compressed digital form with the permission of these institutions. The National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Atlas (POSS-I) was made by the California Institute of Technology with grants from the National Geographic Society. The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-II) was made by the California Institute of Technology with funds from the National Science Foundation, the National Geographic Society, the Sloan Foundation, the Samuel Oschin Foundation, and the Eastman Kodak Corporation. The Oschin Schmidt Telescope is operated by the California Institute of Technology and Palomar Observatory. The UK Schmidt Telescope was operated by the Royal Observatory Edinburgh, with funding from the UK Science and Engineering Research Council (later the UK Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council), until 1988 June, and thereafter by the Anglo-Australian Observatory. The blue plates of the southern Sky Atlas and its Equatorial Extension (together known as the SERC-J), as well as the Equatorial Red (ER), and the Second Epoch [red] Survey (SES) were all taken with the UK Schmidt. Supplemental funding for sky-survey work at the ST ScI is provided by the European Southern Observatory.
